# I completed the assigment 
# Due to time reasons I used the code from https://www.educba.com/fibonacci-series-in-python/ to quickly make a fibannoci algorithm for testing.
# Other notes
## Some design choces were made for the synatx of the W language. 
1. If Statements must have and else block like in Haskell
2. If Statements must follow the form of. PLase see factorial.w or fib.w for more examples
  if 5>3 {
  print "True";
  else {
  print "False";
  }
3. While statments must be in the form of 
  while x<3 {
    print "true";
  }
